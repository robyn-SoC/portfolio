                <p>AJR are the utility management company for several new house builders. My job was to advise the utility suppliers of the new customers moving in to houses built by Bellway Homes.

                <p>Aggregate Industries is the largest company that I have ever worked for. I joined the company as a complete novice and the intention was for them to mold me into the payroll assistant needed due to me not having any preconceptions. I left after realising that the role wasn't really for me.</p>
