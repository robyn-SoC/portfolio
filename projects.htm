                <h4>React.js, Express and CSS</h4>
                <h4>Large portion of front end and some back end</h4>
                <p>This is my largest project to date. Completed in just 3 days in a team of 4 people. Our main aim for this project was to add as much functionality as possible. We were very happy with the final result of this project as we were initally unsure that we would complete it in the time provided.</p>

                <h4>Design and some react front end</h4>
                <p>This is the first full project undertaken after being taught React.js. This was completed with a team of 3 other people. The project was done in a few hours so only our MVP was completed but, we did have stretch goals in mind for if we had completed this sooner. Our MVP came out exactly as planned as we had spent a lot of time on the planning of this project.</p>

                <p>I created this website whilst doing my digital marketing apprenticeship. This is the biggest project I took on before taking a slight career change. The design for this was done by somebody else but I was able to replicate it well.</p>
